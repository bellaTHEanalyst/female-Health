## CHAPTER 5

## 5.0 Discussion of findings 

The study was carried out among the students of school of nursing, Lagos University Teaching Hospital to assess the knowledge and practice of self-breast examination. This chapter contains nursing implications, summary, conclusion, limitation of study and recommendations.

## 5.1. Key Findings	

- 5.1.1 Socio-demographic Data
From the analysis of this study, the socio-demographic data of the respondents shows that out of (100%) respondents, (22%) were between ages 16-19, (60%) were between the ages 20-25 years, (18%) were between the ages 26 years and above.  (36%) were in year 1 and (64%) were in year 2. (48%) were Yoruba, (32%) were Igbo, (0%) were Hausa and (20%) belonged to other ethnic groups.  

- 5.1.2 Knowledge of the students on self-breast examination
The analysis of this study reveals that majority (70%) of the respondents had a good level of knowledge of self-breast examination while (30%) had a poor level of knowledge of self-breast examination. This contradicts a study carried out a study conducted by G Koc et al (2019) a total of 73.3% of the subjects students had heard about BSE. Only half of these students had obtained additional information about BSE While half of the students indicated that they did perform BSE, 33.3% reported doing so at regular intervals. The majority of the students were aware of BSE and its purpose. Only about half stated, however, that they practice it. Those who practiced BSE were not knowledgeable about how and when to perform it and agrees to a study conducted by Ayesha et al (2018) highlighted that the overall response rate was 90.9%. Although 71.4% of the women knew what BSE was, only 33.1% had performed it.  With 59.7% of the population having an adequate amount of knowledge, 87.2% had a positive attitude toward BSE. A medical background was found to be a significant predictor for adequate knowledge and a positive attitude toward BSE.


- 5.1.3 The practice of self-breast examination 

This study showed that (80%) of them practice self-breast examination while (20%) of them do not. This agrees with a study conducted by Birye (2020), the pooled prevalence of breast self-examination practice among healthcare workers in Ethiopia was 56.31%  and a study conducted  by Mostafa, BaniMustafa, Aisha and Mohammed (2015) that  majority of women heard about BSE (91.2 %), only 41.6 % reported ever practicing BSE and 21 % performed it regularly but contradicts a study conducted by Linda, et al (2018) however discovered that only 8.1% of the students performed BSE monthly as recommended, whilst 41.8% had never practiced.
 

- 5.1.4   Factors influencing self-breast
 
 This study showed that majority(85%) agreed that inadequate information on how to carry out selfbreast examiation is a barrier to practicing procedure and (15%) disagreed that inadequate information on how to carry out selfbreast examiation is not  a barrier to practicing procedure ,which agrees with a study conducted by Saber et al, (2015) the most important barriers from the point of view of 1,084 women were lack of knowledge, access barriers (financial, geographical, cultural), fear (of results and pain), performance of service providers, women's beliefs, procrastination of screening, embarrassment, long wait for getting an appointment, language problems, and previous negative experiences.
 
 This study also showed that majority(70%) agreed that lack of awareness of selfbreast examination is one of the factors that influence self breast examination and (30%) disagreed that lack of awareness of selfbreast examination is one of the factors that influence self breast examination which contradicts the study conducted by  Suha Baloushah et al.(2020) the findings suggest that the practice of BSE among women in Gaza is low, with only 40% of the study participants reporting that they never practiced BSE before, even though 76.7% reported that they were aware of BSE. In general, the main barriers to BSE practices were that participants had wrong perceptions and lacked knowledge about BSE. Others also reported fear of detecting breast cancer as a barrier. The practice of BSE among Palestinian women in the Gaza Strip is low and marred with trivial issues as barriers that could be eliminated with dedicated and extensive educational campaigns in the area. 


## 5.2 Implications of Findings to Nursing

- 	Nurses have a role in creating awareness on the practice of self-breast examination.
	
- 	Nurses should organize public enlightenment campaign to educate the public and resolve all forms of misleading information self-breast examination

- 	Nurses should also teach how to carry out self-breast examination.
- 	
## 5.3 Limitations of the Study

- 	Time constraints.
 	
- 	Lack of sincerity on the part of some respondents.
- 	
- 	Unwillingness of respondents to fill questionnaire.

## 5.4	Summary

- The purpose of this study was to find out the knowledge and practice of self-breast examination among the students of school of nursing Lagos University Teaching Hospital. A descriptive research design was used and a self-structured questionnaire that comprised close-ended questions was distributed among 105 nursing students of school of nursing LUTH to collect data and 100 was retrieved. The sample size was determined using a judgmental non-probability sampling technique.

- Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Results were presented using frequency tables, pie charts and bar charts. Chi-square test was used to test hypothesis at a significant level of 0.05. Literature review from previous studies were used in order to form a basis for comparison and evaluation of results. Conceptual and theoretical framework were also reviewed to support the study.

- The findings revealed that majority (70%) of the respondents had a good level of knowledge of self-breast examination while (30%) had a poor level of knowledge of self-breast examination , (80%) of respondents practice self-breast examination, (20%) of respondents do not practice self-breast examination and This study reveals that majority (56.66%) of them agreed to the factors influencing self-breast examination while (43.33%) of them disagreed to the factors influencing self-breast examination   


## 5.5. Conclusion

- This study reveals the level the knowledge and practice of self-breast examination among the students of school of nursing Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos. From this study, it is apparent that majority of the respondents had a good level of knowledge on self-breast examination, while a few had a poor level of knowledge on self-breast examination. Also, majority of the respondents practice self-breast examination, a few of the respondents do not practice self-breast examination.

## 5.6. Recommendations
